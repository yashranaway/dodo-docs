## What is Customer Credit?

Customer Credits provide a flexible way to manage customer balances and enhance billing relationships. With customer credits, you can:

- **Reward loyal customers** with account credits for exceptional service or loyalty programs
- **Issue service credits** to compensate for service interruptions or billing adjustments
- **Handle manual adjustments** without disrupting existing billing cycles
- **Provide refunds** that customers can use for future purchases

<Info>
Customer credits create a positive balance in a customer's account that automatically applies to future subscription payments, reducing the amount charged to their payment method.
</Info>

## How Customer Credits Work

Customer credits operate on a simple principle: available credit is automatically applied to subscription payments before charging the customer's payment method.

### Automatic Credit Application

When a subscription payment is due, Dodo Payments follows this payment sequence:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Credit Balance">
The system checks if the customer has available credit in their account.
</Step>

<Step title="Apply Available Credit">
If credit is available, it's automatically applied to reduce the payment amount.
</Step>

<Step title="Calculate Remaining Balance">
Any remaining amount after credit application is charged to the customer's payment method.
</Step>

<Step title="Process Payment">
The final payment is processed for the remaining balance, if any.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Dodo Payments supports separate credit wallets for INR and USD. Credits added to an INR wallet can only be used for INR subscriptions, while USD wallet credits apply exclusively to USD subscriptions. You cannot use credits from one currency wallet to pay for subscriptions in another currency.
</Info>

### Payment Scenarios

## Understanding the Credit Ledger

The Credit Ledger provides comprehensive tracking and transparency for all customer credit transactions.

### Available Credit Balance

The customer's available credit balance is prominently displayed at the top of the Credit Ledger interface, providing immediate visibility into their current credit status.

**Total Balance Overview**  
The main balance display shows the combined credit amount across all supported currencies, converted to a single currency for easy reference. This unified view helps you quickly assess the customer's total available credit without needing to calculate across multiple currencies.

<Tip>
The total balance is automatically calculated using current exchange rates to provide an accurate combined view of multi-currency credits.
</Tip>

**Currency Breakdown**
Click the "View Breakdown" button to expand the detailed view and see individual balances for each currency:

- **USD Balance**: Shows the exact amount available in US Dollars  
- **INR Balance**: Shows the exact amount available in Indian Rupees
- **Additional Currencies**: Any other currencies with available credit balances

<Note>
The breakdown view is particularly useful when managing customers who make payments in multiple currencies or when you need to verify specific currency allocations.
