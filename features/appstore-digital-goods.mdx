  B -->|Checkout URL| A

  C -->|Redirects / Webhooks| D[Your Server]
  D -->|Grant Access| A
```

1. **Mobile App to Dodo API**: The process begins with the mobile app creating a payment link by interacting with the Dodo API.
2. **Dodo API to Mobile App**: The Dodo API responds by providing a checkout URL back to the mobile app.
3. **Mobile App to Checkout Page**: The mobile app then opens this checkout URL within a WebView, leading the user to the checkout page.
4. **Checkout Page to Your Server**: Upon completion of the checkout process, the checkout page communicates with your server through redirects or webhooks.
5. **Your Server to Mobile App**: Finally, your server grants access to the purchased content or service, completing the transaction cycle back in the mobile app.
