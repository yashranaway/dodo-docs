## What is a subscription upgrade or downgrade?

Changing plans lets you move a customer between subscription tiers or quantities. Use it to:
- Align pricing with usage or features
- Move from monthly to annual (or vice versa)
- Adjust quantity for seat-based products

<Info>
Plan changes can trigger an immediate charge depending on the proration mode you choose.
</Info>

## When to use plan changes

- Upgrade when a customer needs more features, usage, or seats
- Downgrade when usage decreases
- Migrate users to a new product or price without cancelling their subscription

## Prerequisites

Before implementing subscription plan changes, ensure you have:

- A Dodo Payments merchant account with active subscription products
- API credentials (API key and webhook secret key) from the dashboard
- An existing active subscription to modify
- Webhook endpoint configured to handle subscription events

<Info>
For detailed setup instructions, see our [Integration Guide](/developer-resources/integration-guide#dashboard-setup).
</Info>

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

Follow this comprehensive guide to implement subscription plan changes in your application:

<Steps>
<Step title="Understand Plan Change Requirements">
Before implementing, determine:
- Which subscription products can be changed to which others
- What proration mode fits your business model
- How to handle failed plan changes gracefully
- Which webhook events to track for state management

<Tip>
Test plan changes thoroughly in test mode before implementing in production.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Your Proration Strategy">
Select the billing approach that aligns with your business needs:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Fair Billing - prorated_immediately">
Best for: SaaS applications wanting to charge fairly for unused time
- Calculates exact prorated amount based on remaining cycle time
- Charges only the difference between plans
- Provides transparent billing to customers
</Tab>

<Tab title="Simple Upgrade - difference_immediately">
Best for: Clear upgrade/downgrade scenarios
- Upgrade: Charge immediate difference (e.g., $30→$80 = charge $50)
- Downgrade: Credit remaining value for future renewals
- Simplifies billing logic and customer communication
</Tab>

<Tab title="Reset Billing - full_immediately">
Best for: When you want to reset the billing cycle
- Charges full amount of new plan immediately
- Ignores remaining time from old plan
- Useful for annual to monthly transitions
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>

<Step title="Implement the Change Plan API">
Use the Change Plan API to modify subscription details:

<ParamField path="subscription_id" type="string" required>
The ID of the active subscription to modify.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="product_id" type="string" required>
The new product ID to change the subscription to.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="quantity" type="integer" default="1">
Number of units for the new plan (for seat-based products).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="proration_billing_mode" type="string" required>
How to handle immediate billing: `prorated_immediately`, `full_immediately`, or `difference_immediately`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="addons" type="array">
Optional addons for the new plan. Leaving this empty removes any existing addons.
</ParamField>
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Webhook Events">
Set up webhook handling to track plan change outcomes:

- `subscription.active`: Plan change successful, subscription updated
- `subscription.on_hold`: Plan change charge failed, subscription paused
- `payment.succeeded`: Immediate charge for plan change succeeded
- `payment.failed`: Immediate charge failed

<Warning>
Always verify webhook signatures and implement idempotent event processing.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Update Your Application State">
Based on webhook events, update your application:
- Grant/revoke features based on new plan
- Update customer dashboard with new plan details
- Send confirmation emails about plan changes
- Log billing changes for audit purposes
</Step>

<Step title="Test and Monitor">
Thoroughly test your implementation:
- Test all proration modes with different scenarios
- Verify webhook handling works correctly
- Monitor plan change success rates
- Set up alerts for failed plan changes

<Check>
Your subscription plan change implementation is now ready for production use.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Change Plan API

Use the Change Plan API to modify product, quantity, and proration behavior for an active subscription.

### Quick start examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js SDK">
    ```javascript
    import DodoPayments from 'dodopayments';

    const client = new DodoPayments({
      bearerToken: process.env.DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY,
    });

    async function changePlan() {
      const result = await client.subscriptions.changePlan('sub_123', {
        product_id: 'prod_new',
        quantity: 3,
        proration_billing_mode: 'prorated_immediately',
      });
      console.log(result.status, result.invoice_id, result.payment_id);
    }

    changePlan();
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python SDK">
    ```python
    import os
    from dodopayments import DodoPayments

    client = DodoPayments(bearer_token=os.environ.get("DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY"))

    result = client.subscriptions.change_plan(
        subscription_id="sub_123",
        product_id="prod_new",
        quantity=3,
        proration_billing_mode="prorated_immediately",
    )
    print(result.status, result.get("invoice_id"), result.get("payment_id"))
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Go SDK">
    ```go
    package main

    import (
      "context"
      "fmt"
      "github.com/dodopayments/dodopayments-go"
      "github.com/dodopayments/dodopayments-go/option"
    )

    func main() {
      client := dodopayments.NewClient(option.WithBearerToken("YOUR_TOKEN"))
      res, err := client.Subscriptions.ChangePlan(context.TODO(), dodopayments.SubscriptionChangePlanParams{
        SubscriptionID: dodopayments.F("sub_123"),
        ProductID:             dodopayments.F("prod_new"),
        Quantity:              dodopayments.F(int64(3)),
        ProrationBillingMode:  dodopayments.F(dodopayments.SubscriptionChangePlanParamsProrationBillingModeProratedImmediately),
      })
      if err != nil { panic(err) }
      fmt.Println(res.Status, res.InvoiceID, res.PaymentID)
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="HTTP">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "$DODO_API_BASE/subscriptions/sub_123/change-plan" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "product_id": "prod_new",
        "quantity": 3,
        "proration_billing_mode": "prorated_immediately"
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<ResponseExample>
```json Success
{
  "status": "processing",
  "subscription_id": "sub_123",
  "invoice_id": "inv_789",
  "payment_id": "pay_456",
  "proration_billing_mode": "prorated_immediately"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

<Warning>
If the immediate charge fails, the subscription may move to `subscription.on_hold` until payment succeeds.
</Warning>

## Managing Addons

When changing subscription plans, you can also modify addons:

```javascript
// Add addons to the new plan
await client.subscriptions.changePlan('sub_123', {
  product_id: 'prod_new',
  quantity: 1,
  proration_billing_mode: 'difference_immediately',
  addons: [
    { addon_id: 'addon_123', quantity: 2 }
  ]
});

// Remove all existing addons
await client.subscriptions.changePlan('sub_123', {
  product_id: 'prod_new',
  quantity: 1,
  proration_billing_mode: 'difference_immediately',
  addons: [] // Empty array removes all existing addons
});
```

<Info>
Addons are included in the proration calculation and will be charged according to the selected proration mode.
</Info>

## Proration modes

Choose how to bill the customer when changing plans:

#### `prorated_immediately`
- Charges for the partial difference in the current cycle
- If in trial, charges immediately and switches to the new plan now

#### `full_immediately`
- Charges the full amount of the new plan immediately
- Ignores remaining time from the old plan

#### `difference_immediately`
- Upgrade: immediately charge the price difference between old and new plans
- Downgrade: add remaining value as internal credit to the subscription and auto-apply on renewals

### Example scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upgrade: Basic ($30) → Pro ($80) with difference_immediately">
    ```javascript
    await client.subscriptions.changePlan('sub_123', {
      product_id: 'prod_pro',
      quantity: 1,
      proration_billing_mode: 'difference_immediately'
    })
    // Immediate charge: $50
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Downgrade: Plus ($50) → Starter ($20) with difference_immediately">
    ```javascript
    await client.subscriptions.changePlan('sub_123', {
      product_id: 'prod_starter',
      quantity: 1,
      proration_billing_mode: 'difference_immediately'
    })
    // Credit added: $30 (auto-applied to future renewals for this subscription)
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Upgrade mid-cycle with prorated_immediately">
    ```javascript
    await client.subscriptions.changePlan('sub_123', {
      product_id: 'prod_new',
      quantity: 1,
      proration_billing_mode: 'prorated_immediately'
    })
    // Immediate prorated charge based on remaining days in cycle
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reset billing with full_immediately">
    ```javascript
    await client.subscriptions.changePlan('sub_123', {
      product_id: 'prod_new',
      quantity: 1,
      proration_billing_mode: 'full_immediately'
    })
    // Immediate full charge for new plan; no credits calculated
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Pick `prorated_immediately` for fair-time accounting; choose `full_immediately` to restart billing; use `difference_immediately` for simple upgrades and automatic credit on downgrades.
</Tip>

## Handling webhooks

Track subscription state through webhooks to confirm plan changes and payments.

### Event types to handle
- `subscription.active`: subscription activated
- `subscription.on_hold`: charge failed, subscription paused
- `subscription.renewed`: renewal succeeded
- `payment.succeeded`: payment for plan change or renewal succeeded
- `payment.failed`: payment failed

<Info>
We recommend driving business logic from subscription events and using payment events for confirmation and reconciliation.
</Info>

### Verify signatures and handle intents

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Next.js Route Handler">
    ```javascript
    import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

    export async function POST(req) {
      const signature = req.headers.get('x-dodo-signature');
      const secret = process.env.DODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET;

      const payload = await req.text();
      // verifySignature is a placeholder – use your SDK/helper
      const { valid, event } = await verifySignature(payload, signature, secret);
      if (!valid) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid signature' }, { status: 400 });

      switch (event.type) {
        case 'subscription.active':
          // mark subscription active in your DB
          break;
        case 'subscription.on_hold':

          // extend access window
          break;
        case 'payment.succeeded':
          // reconcile payment for plan change
          break;
        case 'payment.failed':
          // log and alert
          break;
        default:
          // ignore unknown events
          break;
      }

      return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Express.js">

## Best Practices

Follow these recommendations for reliable subscription plan changes:

### Plan Change Strategy
- **Test thoroughly**: Always test plan changes in test mode before production
- **Choose proration carefully**: Select the proration mode that aligns with your business model
- **Handle failures gracefully**: Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- **Monitor success rates**: Track plan change success/failure rates and investigate issues

### Webhook Implementation
- **Verify signatures**: Always validate webhook signatures to ensure authenticity
- **Implement idempotency**: Handle duplicate webhook events gracefully
- **Process asynchronously**: Don't block webhook responses with heavy operations
- **Log everything**: Maintain detailed logs for debugging and audit purposes

### User Experience
- **Communicate clearly**: Inform customers about billing changes and timing
- **Provide confirmations**: Send email confirmations for successful plan changes
- **Handle edge cases**: Consider trial periods, prorations, and failed payments
- **Update UI immediately**: Reflect plan changes in your application interface

## Common Issues and Solutions

Resolve typical problems encountered during subscription plan changes:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Charge created but subscription not updated">
**Symptoms**: API call succeeds but subscription remains on old plan

**Common causes**:
- Webhook processing failed or was delayed
- Application state not updated after receiving webhooks
- Database transaction issues during state update

**Solutions**:
- Implement robust webhook handling with retry logic
- Use idempotent operations for state updates
- Add monitoring to detect and alert on missed webhook events
- Verify webhook endpoint is accessible and responding correctly
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Credits not applied after downgrade">
**Symptoms**: Customer downgrades but doesn't see credit balance

**Common causes**:
- Using wrong proration mode (credits only apply with `difference_immediately`)
- Credits are subscription-specific and don't transfer between subscriptions
- Credit balance not visible in customer dashboard

**Solutions**:
- Use `difference_immediately` for downgrades when you want automatic credits
- Explain to customers that credits apply to future renewals of the same subscription
- Implement customer portal to show credit balances
- Check next invoice preview to see applied credits
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Webhook signature verification fails">
**Symptoms**: Webhook events rejected due to invalid signature

**Common causes**:
- Incorrect webhook secret key
- Raw request body modified before signature verification
- Wrong signature verification algorithm

**Solutions**:
- Verify you're using the correct `DODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from dashboard
- Read raw request body before any JSON parsing middleware
- Use the standard webhook verification library for your platform
- Test webhook signature verification in development environment
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Plan change fails with 422 error">
**Symptoms**: API returns 422 Unprocessable Entity error

**Common causes**:
- Invalid subscription ID or product ID
- Subscription not in active state
- Missing required parameters
- Product not available for plan changes

**Solutions**:
- Verify subscription exists and is active
- Check product ID is valid and available
- Ensure all required parameters are provided
- Review API documentation for parameter requirements
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Immediate charge fails during plan change">
**Symptoms**: Plan change initiated but immediate charge fails

**Common causes**:
- Insufficient funds on customer's payment method
- Payment method expired or invalid
- Bank declined the transaction
- Fraud detection blocked the charge

**Solutions**:
- Handle `payment.failed` webhook events appropriately
- Notify customer to update payment method
- Implement retry logic for temporary failures
- Consider allowing plan changes with failed immediate charges
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
