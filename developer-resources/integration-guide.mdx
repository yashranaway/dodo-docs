## Prerequisites

To integrate the Dodo Payments API, you'll need:
- A Dodo Payments merchant account
- API Credentials (API key and webhook secret key) from dashboard

If you don't have an account yet, you can get your business approved by [contacting the founder](https://demo.dodopayments.com/) or by filling out this [form](https://dodopayments.com/early-access).

## Dashboard Setup

1. Navigate to the [Dodo Payments Dashboard](https://app.dodopayments.com/)

2. Create a product (one-time payment or subscription)
    - [Detailed Guide](/guides/one-time-product)
    
3. Test the checkout flow:
   - Click the share button on the product page
   - Open the link in your browser
   - Use test card number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Enter any future expiration date and any 3-digit CVV

4. Generate your API key:
   - Go to Settings > API
   - [Detailed Guide](/api-reference/introduction#api-key-generation)
   - Copy the API key the in env named DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY

5. Configure webhooks:
   - Go to Settings > Webhooks
   - Create a webhook URL for payment notifications
   - [Detailed Guide](/guides/webhook-setup)
   - Copy the webhook secret key in env 

## API Integration

### Payment Links

Dodo Payments supports two types of payment links:

#### 1. Static Payment Links

Simple to create by appending your product ID to the base URL:

```
https://checkout.dodopayments.com/buy/{productid}?quantity=1&redirect_url={your website return_url}
```
This link accepts query parameters that are processed through our Query Collector System. When parameters are provided, they are stored in session storage with a unique ID (e.g., `sess_1a2b3c4d`) and made available throughout the checkout flow.

The supported query parameters are:

**Core Parameters:**
- `quantity`: The quantity of the product to be purchased. Default is 1.
- `redirect_url`: URL to redirect after payment completion.
  
    **Note:** The redirect URL will include payment details as query parameters:
    ```
    https://example.com/?payment_id=pay_ts2ySpzg07phGeBZqePbH&status=succeeded
    ```

**Customer Information:**
- `fullName`: Customer's full name (ignored if firstName or lastName is provided)
- `firstName`: Customer's first name
- `lastName`: Customer's last name
- `email`: Customer's email address
- `country`: Customer's country
- `addressLine`: Customer's street address
- `city`: Customer's city
- `state`: Customer's state/province
- `zipCode`: Customer's postal/ZIP code

**Form Field Controls:**
The following flags can disable form fields, but only take effect when the associated field data is also provided:
- `disableFullName`: Disables fullName field (requires fullName parameter)
- `disableFirstName`: Disables fullName field (requires fullName parameter)
- `disableLastName`: Disables fullName field (requires fullName parameter)
- `disableEmail`: Disables email field (requires email parameter)
- `disableCountry`: Disables country field (requires country parameter)
- `disableAddressLine`: Disables address field (requires addressLine parameter)
- `disableCity`: Disables city field (requires city parameter)
- `disableState`: Disables state field (requires state parameter)
- `disableZipCode`: Disables ZIP code field (requires zipCode parameter)
- `paymentCurrency`: Specifies the payment currency. Default is set as per the billing country.
- `showCurrencySelector`: Shows the currency selector. Default is true.

**Custom Data:**
- Metadata fields can be passed using the `metadata_` prefix
  Example: `metadata_orderId=123` or `metadata_customerNote=Special instructions`
- `paymentAmount`: Specifies the payment amount in cents (e.g., $10.00 would be entered as 1000). This parameter is exclusively available for one-time payment links that use Pay What You Want (PWYW) pricing model.

When a customer visits the payment link, all query parameters are collected and stored with a session ID. The URL is then simplified to include just the session parameter (e.g., `?session=sess_1a2b3c4d`). The stored information persists through page refreshes and is accessible throughout the checkout process.

#### 2. Dynamic Payment Links
Created via API call or our sdk with customer details. Here's an example:

There are two APIs for creating dynamic payment links:

- One-time Payment Link API [API reference](/api-reference/payments/post-payments)
- Subscription Payment Link API [API reference](/api-reference/subscriptions/post-subscriptions)

The guide below is for one-time payment link creation.

For detailed instructions on integrating subscriptions, refer to this [Subscription Integration Guide](/developer-resources/subscription-integration-guide).

<Info>Make sure you are passing `payment_link = true` to get payment link </Info>

Node.js SDK is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dodopayments/dodopayments-node).

Python SDK is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dodopayments/dodopayments-python).

Go SDK is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dodopayments/dodopayments-go).

For detailed API request body requirements, consult our [API Reference](/api-reference/payments/post-payments). 

<Info>After creating the payment link, redirect your customers to complete their payment.</Info>

#### 3.Overlay Checkout

For a seamless in-page checkout experience, explore our [Overlay Checkout](/developer-resources/overlay-checkout) integration that allows customers to complete payments without leaving your website.

### Implementing Webhooks

Set up an API endpoint to receive payment notifications. Here's an example using Next.js:

```javascript
import { Webhook } from "standardwebhooks";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { WebhookPayload } from "@/types/api-types";

const webhook = new Webhook(process.env.DODO_WEBHOOK_KEY!); // Replace with your secret key generated from the Dodo Payments Dashboard

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const headersList = headers();
  const rawBody = await request.text();

  const webhookHeaders = {
    "webhook-id": headersList.get("webhook-id") || "",
    "webhook-signature": headersList.get("webhook-signature") || "",
    "webhook-timestamp": headersList.get("webhook-timestamp") || "",
  };

  await webhook.verify(rawBody, webhookHeaders);
  const payload = JSON.parse(rawBody) as WebhookPayload;
  
  // Process the payload according to your business logic
}
```

Our webhook implementation follows the [Standard Webhooks](https://standardwebhooks.com/) specification. For webhook type definitions, refer to our [Webhook Event Guide](/developer-resources/webhooks/intents/webhook-events-guide).

You can refer to this project with demo implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/dodopayments/dodo-checkout-demo) using Next.js and TypeScript.

You can check out the live implementation [here](https://atlas.dodopayments.com/).
