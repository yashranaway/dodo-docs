## Creating a Meter

Meters define how your usage events are aggregated and measured for billing purposes.

Before creating a meter, plan your usage tracking strategy:
- Identify what usage events you want to track
- Determine how events should be aggregated (count, sum, etc.)
- Define any filtering requirements for specific use cases

### Step-by-Step Meter Creation

Follow this comprehensive guide to set up your usage meter:

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure Basic Information">
Set up the fundamental details for your meter.

<ParamField path="Meter Name" type="string" required>
Choose a clear, descriptive name that identifies what this meter tracks.

Examples: "Tokens", "API Calls", "Storage Usage", "Compute Hours"
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Description" type="string">
Provide a detailed explanation of what this meter measures.

Example: "Counts each POST /v1/orders request made by the customer"
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Event Name" type="string" required>
Specify the event identifier that will trigger this meter.

Examples: "token", "api.call", "storage.usage", "compute.session"
</ParamField>

<Info>
The event name must match exactly what you send in your usage events. Event names are case-sensitive.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Aggregation Settings">
Define how the meter calculates usage from your events.

<ParamField path="Aggregation Type" type="string" required>
Select how events should be aggregated:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Count">
Simply counts the number of events received.

Use case: API calls, page views, file uploads

Calculation: Total number of events
</Tab>

<Tab title="Sum">
Adds up values from a specific property in your events.

Use case: Data transfer, storage consumption, processing time

Calculation: Sum of all property values
</Tab>


<Tab title="Max">
Records the highest value of a specific property during the billing period.

Use case: Peak concurrent users, maximum storage used, highest bandwidth

Calculation: Maximum property value observed
</Tab>

<Tab title="Last">
Uses the most recent value of a specific property.

Use case: Current plan tier, latest configuration setting

Calculation: Last recorded property value
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Over Property" type="string">
The property name from event metadata to aggregate over.

<Warning>
This field is required when using Sum, Max, or Last aggregation types.
</Warning>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Measurement Unit" type="string" required>
Define the unit label for display purposes in reports and billing.

Examples: "calls", "GB", "hours", "tokens"
</ParamField>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Event Filtering (Optional)">
Set up criteria to control which events are included in the meter.

<Info>
Event filtering allows you to create sophisticated rules that determine which events contribute to your usage calculations. This is useful for excluding test events, filtering by user tiers, or focusing on specific actions.
</Info>

**Enable Event Filtering**

Toggle **Enable Event Filtering** to activate conditional event processing.

**Choose Filter Logic**

Select how multiple conditions are evaluated:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="AND Logic">
All conditions must be true for an event to be counted. Use this when you need events to meet multiple strict criteria simultaneously.

**Example:** Count API calls where `user_tier = "premium"` AND `endpoint = "/api/v2/users"`
</Tab>

<Tab title="OR Logic">
At least one condition must be true for an event to be counted. Use this when you want to include events that meet any of several criteria.

**Example:** Count events where `method = "POST"` OR `method = "PUT"` OR `method = "DELETE"`
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Setting Up Filter Conditions**

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Condition">
Click **Add condition** to create a new filter rule.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Property Key">
Specify the property name from your event metadata.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Comparator">
Choose from available operators:
- `equals` - Exact match
- `not equals` - Exclusion filter
- `greater than` - Numeric comparison  
- `greater than or equals` - Numeric comparison (inclusive)
- `less than` - Numeric comparison
- `less than or equals` - Numeric comparison (inclusive)
- `contains` - String contains substring
- `does not contain` - String exclusion filter
</Step>

<Step title="Set Comparison Value">
Set the target value for comparison.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Groups">
Use **Add Group** to create additional condition groups for complex logic.
</Step>
</Steps>


<Warning>
Filtered properties must be included in your event metadata for the conditions to work properly. Events missing required properties will be excluded from counting.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Meter">
Review your meter configuration and click on **Create Meter**.

<Check>
Your meter is now ready to receive and aggregate usage events.
</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Linking Meter in a Product

Once you have created your meter, you need to link it to a product to enable usage-based billing. This process connects your meter's usage data to pricing rules for customer billing.

Linking meters to products establishes the connection between usage tracking and billing:
- Products define pricing rules and billing behavior
- Meters provide usage data for billing calculations
- Multiple meters can be linked to a single product for complex billing scenarios

### Product Configuration Process

Transform your usage data into billable charges by properly configuring your product settings:

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose Usage-Based Billing Product Type">
Navigate to your product creation or editing page and select **Usage-Based** as the product type.

</Step>

<Step title="Select Associated Meter">
Click on **Associated Meter** to open the meter selection panel from the side.


This panel allows you to configure which meters will track usage for this product.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Your Meter">
In the meter selection panel:

1. Click **Add Meters** to view available meters
2. Select the meter you created from the dropdown list
3. The selected meter will appear in your product configuration

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Price Per Unit">
Set the pricing for each unit of usage tracked by your meter.

<ParamField path="Price Per Unit" type="number" required>
Define how much to charge for each unit measured by your meter.

**Example**: Setting `$0.50` per unit means:
- 1,000 units consumed = 1,000 × $0.50 = 500.00 charged
- 500 units consumed = 500 × $0.50 = 250.00 charged
- 100 units consumed = 100 × $0.50 = 50.00 charged
</ParamField>

</Step>

<Step title="Set Free Threshold (Optional)">
Configure a free usage allowance before billing begins.

<ParamField path="Free Threshold" type="number">
Number of units customers can consume at no charge before paid usage calculation starts.

**How it works**:
- Free threshold: 100 units
- Price per unit: $0.50
- Customer usage: 250 units
- **Calculation**: (250 - 100) × $0.50 = **$75.00** charged
</ParamField>

<Info>
Free thresholds are ideal for freemium models, trial periods, or providing customers with a base allowance included in their plan.
</Info>

<Check>
The free threshold applies to each billing cycle, giving customers fresh allowances monthly or according to your billing schedule.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Save Configuration">
Review your meter and pricing configuration, then click **Save Changes** to finalize the setup.

<Check>
Your product is now configured for usage-based billing and will automatically charge customers based on their measured consumption.
</Check>

**What happens next**:
- Usage events sent to your meter will be tracked and aggregated
- Billing calculations will apply your pricing rules automatically
- Customers will be charged based on actual consumption during each billing cycle
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Remember that you can add up to 10 meters per product, enabling sophisticated usage tracking across multiple dimensions like API calls, storage, compute time, and custom metrics.
</Note>

## Sending Usage Events

Once your meter is configured, you can start sending usage events from your application to track customer usage.


### Event Structure

Each usage event must include these required fields:

<ParamField body="event_id" type="string" required>
Unique identifier for this specific event. Must be unique across all events.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="customer_id" type="string" required>
The Dodo Payments customer ID this usage should be attributed to.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="event_name" type="string" required>
The event name that matches your meter configuration. Event names trigger the appropriate meter.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="timestamp" type="string">
ISO 8601 timestamp when the event occurred. Defaults to current time if not provided.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="metadata" type="object">
Additional properties for filtering and aggregation. Include any values referenced in your meter's "Over Property" or filtering conditions.
</ParamField>

### Usage Events API Examples
