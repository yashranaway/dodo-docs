## Introduction

Metadata allows you to store additional, structured information about your objects in Dodo Payments. You can attach metadata to most Dodo Payments objects, including payments, subscriptions, and more.

## Overview

- Metadata keys can be up to 40 characters long
- Metadata values can be up to 500 characters long
- You can have up to 50 metadata key-value pairs per object
- Keys should only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores
- Metadata is not searchable using our API but is returned in API responses and webhooks

## Use Cases

Metadata is useful for:

- Storing external IDs or references
- Adding internal annotations
- Linking Dodo Payments objects to your system
- Categorizing transactions
- Adding custom attributes for reporting

## Adding Metadata

You can add metadata when creating or updating objects through the API. For products, you also have the option to add metadata directly from the dashboard UI.

### Via API

```javascript
// Adding metadata when creating a payment
const payment = await client.payments.create({
    billing: { city: 'city', country: 'AF', state: 'state', street: 'street', zipcode: 0 },
    customer: { customer_id: 'customer_id' },
    product_cart: [{ product_id: 'product_id', quantity: 0 }],
    metadata:{order_id: 'ORD-123', customer_notes: 'Customer notes'}
  });

// Adding metadata when creating a product
const product = await client.products.create({
    name: 'Premium Software License',
    price: 9900,
    currency: 'USD',
    metadata: {
        category: 'software',
        license_type: 'premium',
        support_tier: 'priority'
    }
});
```

### Via Dashboard UI (Products Only)

For products, you can also add metadata directly from the Dodo Payments dashboard when creating or editing a product. The metadata section allows you to easily add custom key-value pairs without writing code.

<Tip>
Using the dashboard UI for product metadata is particularly useful for non-technical team members who need to manage product information and categories.

## Retrieving Metadata

Metadata is included in API responses when retrieving objects:

```javascript
const payment = await client.payments.retrieve('pay_123');
console.log(payment.metadata.order_id); // '6735'
```

## Searching and Filtering

While metadata is not directly searchable via our API, you can:

1. Store important identifiers in metadata
2. Retrieve objects using their primary IDs
3. Filter the results in your application code

```javascript
// Example: Find a payment using your order ID
const payments = await client.payments.list({
  limit: 100
});

const matchingPayment = payments.data.find(
  payment => payment.metadata.order_id === '6735'
);
```

## Best Practices

### Do:
- Use consistent naming conventions for metadata keys
- Document your metadata schema internally
- Keep values short and meaningful
- Use metadata for static data only
- Consider using prefixes for different systems (e.g., `crm_id`, `inventory_sku`)

### Don't:
- Store sensitive data in metadata
- Use metadata for frequently changing values
- Rely on metadata for critical business logic
- Store duplicate information that's available elsewhere in the object
- Use special characters in metadata keys

## Supported Objects

Metadata is supported on the following objects:

| Object Type | Support |
|------------|---------|
| Payments | ✓ |
| Subscriptions | ✓ |
| Products | ✓ |

## Webhooks and Metadata

Metadata is included in webhook events, making it easy to handle notifications with your custom data:

```javascript
// Example webhook handler
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  if (event.type === 'payment.succeeded') {
    const orderId = event.data.object.metadata.order_id;
    // Process order using your internal order ID
  }
});
```
